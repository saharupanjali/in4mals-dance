<h4 class="A">Suparna Roy Gupta</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Suparna Roy Gupta, the dance coordinator of IN4MALS society. I began my dance career at DR. RUMPA SINHA'S  NATYALAYA from the age of 2yr. I am doing a junior diploma course in Bharatnatyam also from Prayag Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya. I have competed in many national level and state level competitions. I have also attended many seminars in state & national level also competed in many school level & state, national level competitions. Some of my other skills include contemporary, semi-classical and bollywood dance. Recently I'm co-ordinating the dance group of IN4MALS. I try to guide & motivate all the members in our dance society. What I think about  Dance is ,it  is a form of expression that brings people together, allows them to be creative in new ways, and is a fantastic way to escape the stresses and cares of everyday life. When I dance I am completely get released from the preoccupations and stresses of day to day life. Growth never comes from the comfort zone. Every time I dance or perform I feel like I am stepping into a new realm in which gives me an opportunity to grow and discover new things about my dance technique or even myself as a person. I enjoy growth, and performing is a wonderful catalyst in which this can happen. To know more about me, about the dance forms or to join with us visit my official instagram page.</p>

<h4 class="A">Adyasha Mohanty</h4>
<p>Hi, I'm Adyasha Mohanty. I am a professionally trained dancer and started my journey in dancing at the age of 5 years. Ever Since I watched bollywood actors dancing in movies, I wanted to do that. All thanks to my parents who supported me and started giving me professional training since I was 4 years old. It's been more than 12-13 years since I am performing. I am professionally trained in Odissi but also perform in bollywood, semiclassical forms as well. Odissi is a beautiful dance form where we depict stories through postures,mudras and expressions. It has a very unique costume when it comes to attire. I have completed my 3rd year Odissi exams also and have an experience of performing for more than 12-13 years. I have competed in many national and international level programs as well. I'm here in IN4MALS members of our dance team since 1-2 months & already took part in 2 projects. IN4MALS society has already given me the chance to be a part of two projects which were done online because of the pandemic. I expect, as soon as things get normal, we'd meet offline, we will start performing on stage and my skills will be even more enhanced. To know more about me you can reach me out in my Instagram page. You can also visit my youtube channel to watch my videos & stay tunned.

<p>Hi, I'm Oshmita Sarkar. I'm a second year student of CSE. I have a specialization in Bharatanatyam and have also given performances in folk, fusion and regional dances. I have participated in various competitions of the IIT's and have made it to the finals. I also took part in the KORUS fest of KIIT and have been a part of various local projects of In4mals for its social media page and YouTube channel. For me, dance is like a spiritual purification. Every move, every beat creates an aura of positivity within me. I have been a passionate dancer since childhood and still continue the learning process as I believe that learning must never stop. In4mals has provided me with a platform to showcase my individuality as well as the tallents that I have achieved from continuous practices. I specialise in classical dance along with folk, bollywood and regional dances. I can firmly affirm that being a part of this society has helped me grow as a dancer and unleashed a new being within me.To know more about me reach me out at my official instagram page.</p>
